Logo Scraper and Processor

This project consists of several Python scripts designed to scrape logos from websites, process them, and store them in various formats. Below is an overview of each script and its functionality.

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.x (I used 3.8)

Installation

Using pip

You can install the necessary packages using pip: pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas pillow

Using Conda

Alternatively, you can set up a Conda environment and install the required packages:

1.	Create a new Conda environment: conda create --name logoscraper python=3.9
2.	Activate the environment: conda activate logoscraper
3.	Install the necessary packages: conda install -c conda-forge requests beautifulsoup4 pandas pillow
  

Scripts

1. gatherpic.py

This script scrapes logos from a specified website (https://www.bayviewgolfclub.com.au) and saves them to a logos directory.

Key Features:

	•	Scrapes all images from the specified website.
	•	Filters the images to download only those that contain “logo” in their URL.
	•	Saves the downloaded images in a logos directory with the suffix _logo added to the filename.

Usage: python gatherpic.py

2. gathertocsv.py

This script reads a CSV file (5lines.csv) containing website URLs and user information. It then scrapes logos from these websites, encodes them in base64, and saves the results into a new CSV file (websites_with_logos.csv).

Key Features:

	•	Reads website URLs from a CSV file.
	•	Scrapes the logo image from each website.
	•	Converts the logo image to a base64 string.
	•	Stores the base64 encoded logos along with user information in a new CSV file.

Usage: python gathertocsv.py

3. getherpic1.py

This script reads a CSV file (5lines.csv) containing website URLs and user information. It then scrapes logos from these websites and saves them locally in a logos directory.

Key Features:

	•	Reads website URLs from a CSV file.
	•	Scrapes the logo image from each website.
	•	Saves the logo images locally in a logos directory with filenames based on the user ID.

Usage: python getherpic1.py

4. readimage.py

This script reads the CSV file (websites_with_logos.csv) generated by gathertocsv.py and displays the logos stored as base64 encoded strings.

Key Features:

	•	Reads base64 encoded logo images from a CSV file.
	•	Decodes the base64 strings and displays the images.

Usage: python readimage.py

Files

	•	5lines.csv: Input CSV file containing website URLs, email addresses, and user IDs.
	•	logos: Directory where the downloaded logo images are saved.
	•	websites_with_logos.csv: Output CSV file generated by gathertocsv.py, containing base64 encoded logos.
