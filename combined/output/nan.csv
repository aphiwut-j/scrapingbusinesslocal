What is chiropractic?
Chiropractic is a healthcare discipline that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, particularly the spine. Chiropractors primarily use their hands to perform manual adjustments and manipulations to the spine or other parts of the body. The goal of chiropractic care is to alleviate pain, improve function, and promote the body's natural ability to heal itself without the use of medication or surgery.
Chiropractors believe that proper alignment of the body's musculoskeletal structure, particularly the spine, allows the body to heal itself. They use various techniques, including spinal adjustments, manipulation, and other manual therapies to address issues related to the body's alignment, joint mobility, and overall musculoskeletal function.
Chiropractic services are commonly sought for conditions such as back pain, neck pain, headaches, and musculoskeletal issues. Chiropractors may also provide advice on exercise, ergonomics, and lifestyle changes to complement their treatments.
Benefits of chiropractic care

About
Charmaine is a Kinesiologist and Natural Therapist, helping others to improve their health and well-being since 2005. Over the years, she has mastered many aspects of gentle yet powerful natural treatments, and her methods combine Kinesiology, Spinal Flow, Forensic Healing, Body Talk, Access Consciousness, Theta and Pranic healing, ITA (Integrated Therapeutic Alignment) Reiki and many more. Charmaine is dedicated to helping others become the best version of themselves, and leading happy and healthy lives. Our subconscious thoughts and feelings can have a huge effect on our lives and sometimes prevent us from achieving wellbeing. These energy blocks and imbalances in our bodies can manifest as emotional issues and even physical symptoms, which can hold us back in everyday life.
By working with the body-mind-soul connection, Charmaine can help you address these subconscious issues, and help you create more positive and beneficial thought patterns. Once you’ve cleared these energy blocks and negative thought patterns, your body can then activate the healing process. Charmaine will work closely with you to find the issues, and arrive at the optimum treatment methods for you as an individual. Based in Baldivis, Western Australia, Charmaine has helped numerous people in Perth, WA and beyond, so whether you’re in Rockingham, Mandurah or further afield, you could benefit from Charmaine’s uniquely successful alternative therapy techniques. Some sessions can even be conducted over Skype.
If you’ve tried everything else to no avail, maybe it’s time to try out an Alternative Natural Therapist! Get in touch today - you owe it to yourself.

Services
Charmaine is a Natural Therapist and Kinesiologist who offers a wide range of services that can improve both your mental and physical health and well-being. Here are some of the main alternative therapy techniques that could help you:
Kinesiology
Spinal Flow
Forensic Healing
BodyTalk Therapy
Access Consciousness
Kinesiology
is a natural and non-invasive type of therapy, that makes use of gentle muscle monitoring techniques to identify certain blocks and imbalances in the body.  Kinesiology strives to treat the body holistically, recognising the fact that all of the systems of the body are linked.
It uses Western techniques, combined with ancient Eastern wisdom, to provide a gentle yet effective solution.
The premise of kinesiology is that the body has innate healing energy (or ‘Qi’, as it’s referred to in China). It is always doing its best to care for itself, but sometimes you may need to give it a helping hand and put your body into a better position. Flows of energy relate to all the muscles, organs and other tissues of the body that help make you a living being. Energy blocks, though, can manifest as symptoms such as:
Stress
Anxiety
Depression
Fatigue
Physical pain
Emotional problems
Neurological problems
Hormone imbalances
Nutritional problems
Loss of brain integration
Kinesiology doesn’t work by simply treating these symptoms though - you have to look at the body as a whole before you can treat the issue. By using muscle monitoring/muscle testing techniques, kinesiology practitioners can help reveal imbalances, identify the cause, and then help to resolve it. Whether physical, emotional or even spiritual, there could be various reasons for your current condition. A trained Kinesiologist such as Charmaine can access this information, and help you facilitate the natural healing process of your body. With her innovative methods and friendly persona, you’re likely to see significant results when you undergo this non-invasive form of natural therapy.
Spinal Flow
works with the spine and nervous system to increase the bodies life force energy so
that it can heal.
The body has its own wisdom and intelligence, but what happens over time is our bodies experience
chemical, physical and emotional stressors which get stored in the body and create blockages in our
systems and this affects our bodies healing abilities. These blockages can be found in the 7
Gateways of the spine and show up as pain, disease, illness and other physical symptoms.
Spinal Flow uses Access Points found in the sacrum and cranial areas. These access points are
actually areas of ease and by contacting them and expanding them, Charmaine is able to guide you
into bringing in more breath, sensing, movement and flow into the body creating a healing wave of
energy up through the spine and nervous system to the brain. This allows the nervous system to
send different signals allowing your bodies intelligence to find the blocks and release them.
Forensic Healing
involves collecting evidence about a condition much like a detective at the scene
of a crime. Forensic Healing will investigate the who, what, where and why clues in your energy field
as to the reasons you have your condition and release them using the application of different healing
pathways.
Your body stores all of your past experiences including thoughts, feelings and emotions which all
impact your life in some way. Any disfunction on a physical, emotional, energetic or spiritual level
creating issues such as pain, stress, anxiety, tiredness, fear, grief, hurt, low self-worth, relationship
issues, health issues and energy blocks can be investigated using Forensic Healing.
Using Biofeedback methods (similar to Kinesiology), Forensic Healing identifies the most impactful
times/stresses that created the blocks in the clients’ energy field, along with any negative life
patterns, emotions, belief systems etc. that have been stored in the cellular memory or DNA. When
these energetic blocks are released through applying the appropriate healing pathway, the situation
or condition changes and allows the body to heal itself.
BodyTalk Therapy
is another method that seeks to address and treat the ‘whole person’, rather than just the individual symptom. By looking at the bigger picture (overall emotional, physical and environmental factors) Charmaine can start to find the underlying cause of your issues by focusing on the bigger picture.
BodyTalk is therefore a completely custom and personalised method of treatment, which will be different for every individual. By allowing the body’s energy systems to be re-synchronised, the communication between all systems can be re-established; allowing them to operate as nature intended once again.
Ultimately, your body knows how to treat itself, but sometimes it needs a little help along the way, and Charmaine is an expert in finding the cause and solution for your ailments. With conversation and methods including tapping gently on your head, sternum and navel, Charmaine can tap into your body’s innate wisdom and help bring it back to its original balanced state.
Access Consciousness
is a powerful method of natural therapy, that can help you properly take control of your life again and change things you’ve never been able to before. It’s comprised of a simple set of tools, techniques and philosophies that empower you to create the changes in your life that you desire.
Charmaine is a natural therapist who is well-versed in various aspects of Access Consciousness, and is the perfect person to help you work through your issues in a productive way, and get on the road to healing. In your relaxed and comfortable sessions, you’ll work with her on a number of techniques for improved perspective on life, and the removal of these mental and energetic barriers holding you back.
Part of Access Consciousness is something called ‘BARS’. This refers to a set of 32 points on the head which, when touched gently, allow the flow of energy through these points. This then releases a cascade of thoughts, feelings, emotions, limitations, behavioural patterns, judgements, belief systems and more that have been stored and built-up throughout your lifetime. Having your ‘BARS’ run allows the clearing of limitations that you may have about different areas of your life, and helps you to stop living through past experiences.
Charmaine can also offer any combination of other modalities that are a priority for your body. If you’d like to learn more about these gentle and effective natural alternative therapy techniques, then get in touch today on

Testimonials
I cannot recommend Charmaine enough. I lost my husband a year ago after battling a very serious illness
for two years and have my own health issues. I have tried various mainstream and natural healing
modalities to assist my healing process, which has been more difficult due to a variety of factors. A friend
recommended Charmaine to me while visiting family in Perth. After two sessions with Charmaine, I finally
feel like ‘myself’, with immediate changes physically and emotionally. I am finally empowered to live life,
joyful and determined for my future. Charmaine’s skills in a variety of modalities and her own skills are a
gift. We are unique. We need unique healing for our individuality. It has been a blessing for me to find her.
Sharon - Tasmania
I highly recommend Charmaine and have recommended her to many friends. I have been seeing her for 2
years now and her work has literally saved my life. My first session I walked in with suicidal thoughts and
an hour and a half later they were gone and have never returned. Whenever I need a ""tune-up"" I head
straight to Charmaine and I am never disappointed with the results.
Christine - Darlington
Charmaine is a gifted and brilliant practitioner on both physical and metaphysical levels. Her commitment and ability to get a result has been incredible. I would recommend her to anyone seeking to grow, shift and change to a better human being. One of the best investments in self that I have ever made.

Thank you Charmaine for your commitment and love
Blessings - Mark
For at least the previous 12 months before I saw you last week I’ve had the most horrendous back and neck pain – which was only being managed by ridiculously regular Chiro and massage appointments Since I saw you I’ve had barely any back and neck pains. I thought I’d let you know as it’s a massive change for me and my life and I’m very thankful for what you have done for me.
Jemma – Secret Harbour
I suffered tummy problems for at least 7 years before seeing Charmaine. The pain I lived with daily is now in the past.. She also treated my ongoing battle with daily headaches and monthly migraines. I lived with this pain for so long I never thought it possible that I could put it behind me and live in peace and experience such balance and happiness within myself.
Amber – Warnbro
I can’t find enough words to say thank you, it’s a blessing that someone actually gave my wife some consideration and the fact that you cared about her is very touching…Thanks once again Charmaine – you really have touched our hearts. Keep up the good work!
Mark – Port Kennedy
Charmaine is a beautiful soul and unbelievably gifted energy healer who uses a whole range of modalities. I highly recommend anyone who is needing a lift, feeling out of sorts, stagnant, stuck, depressed, suffering with trauma, etc. to get in touch with her. She has helped me so much over the years… I cannot speak highly enough of her.
Kylie – Rockingham
My sessions with you have brought about major breakthroughs that I was hoping for. This new found       state of being for me has been miraculous as in a short space of 3 months I feel safe and secure in my work environment, I have a new relationship with a wonderful man, and am making and manifesting exciting plans for the future. I now know and can say with absolute conviction that if I really want to change what I don’t like about my life or if I want to manifest my goals, I will be returning to you for a tune-up!!  IT WORKS!!

About Maria
Born in Tully, Far North Queensland, I have been a Celebrant here in the Tropical North since 2008 and a JP Qualified since 2000.
Being a local I have a good knowledge of Tully, Mission Beach and surrounding townships and cities along the coast from Cairns to Townsville and can share with you some great ceremony location options, if you wish.
Every couple is special and unique and all share their own love story. It’s always a pleasure to share the couple’s joy, along with the gathering of family and friends on their very special day.  Whether you choose a ceremony with moving formality or one of relaxed simplicity, I care to make it both a memorable and truly personal occasion every time.
""Maria, thank you so much for making
the day so perfect and special!""

Hi, I’m Sharon Tal, The Soul Alchemist.
We live in a complex world. It’s no wonder so many of us feel blocked or have a feeling of disconnect, stuckness or lack in our lives.
As The Soul Alchemist, I have a calling to facilitate people’s healing journey, because let’s face it, we’ve all had hurts in our lives. I believe healing therapies have the potential to cleanse your body, heal your heart and nourish your soul.
By accessing and clearing the ‘black box’ of our memories, I help people move from survive and revive to thrive and beyond!
I work with traumas on many different levels to restore Self Love, and nurture the Inner Child in each and every one of us. Ultimately, my aim is to guide you to live to your fullest potential, even beyond your wildest dreams.
Are you ready to join me on this wonderful journey?
In trust,
HOW I CAN HELP
I specialise in clearing unresolved
traumas and blockages which may manifest in the following symptoms:
Stress, anxiety or depression
Feelings of disconnect, lack or fear
Self or external sabotage
Allergies
Relationship problems
Smoking and other addictions
Misunderstood anger
Prolonged grief
Physical pain, headaches, migraines
Weight gain/loss
Adrenal fatigue & TMJ (pain in the jaw)
Modalities
After more than 20 years working with thousands of clients, I've discovered that when you go through trauma, it's best to treat it like any other injury. It needs to be attended to. I offer many modalities to help you in the healing process:
Kinesiology
A non-invasive method of healing based on chiropractic and the ancient wisdom of the Chinese meridian system.
Counselling
Counselling in a safe, supportive environment with someone you trust offers a great opportunity to grow and heal.
Reiki & Seichem
Used for thousands of years, Reiki and Seichem allow us to tap into the unvesal energy that is your birthright.
RESET TMJ Healing
Even the slightest tension in the jaw muscles can cause the jaw to be out of balance, having a ripple effect throughout your body.
Psychic Readings & Tarot
A psychic reading or tarot card reading can help you to feel enlightened, empowered and offers positive guidance.
American Indian Healing
Embrace the ancient healing art practiced by American Indians to treat almost any condition whether psychological or physical.
Pet Healing
Pet healing helps to clear blockages, allowing trauma and stress to disperse or injuries and sickness to heal.
Ear Candling
Ear candling clears your sinus and ear congestion by removing wax build-up, removing wax that normal cleaning cannot.
AS A HEALER, I AM HERE TO SUPPORT YOU TO STEP INTO YOUR OWN
POWER AND STAND IN YOUR TRUTH, WHATEVER FORM THAT TAKES.

As a family owned and operated business we are committed to providing fast and effective pipe freezing solutions in order to get your pipes flowing at their optimal capacity in no time!
All of our technicians are equipped with the latest in pipe freezing technology, an expansive knowledge of safe and effective methods and most importantly a friendly smile. All works are fully insured and follow strict safety measures, also known as (SWMS) Safe Work Method Statements. With our same day service guarantee, we make it easy!

No matter the pipe, or the flow, Quick Freeze is the way to go!
Our services
Residential
Here at Quick Freeze we hold ourselves to the highest standard working ethic and ensure that regardless of the job, big or small, we put in 100% of our efforts towards a safe and effective freeze. This is because we believe that pipe freezing is the most cost and time effective method of system isolation.
When your home needs a plumbing repair, it can often lead to puddled mess, but with Quick Freeze we’ll ensure that your water flows only as you please. We provide a helping hand with your local plumber to help get your repairs and installations well underway without the messy pool!
Commercial
Plumbing can be messy work for any site but, when you have a business to run, the last thing you need is an extended downtime period for a repair or installation. Whether you run a bar, pub or restaurant you simply can’t afford to have your liquid flow disturbed for a prolonged period. Cue the Quick Freeze experts! We’ll provide the best pipe freezing alternatives to guarantee your business is back up and running in record time.
Pipe freezing involves the controlled use of liquid nitrogen to isolate and freeze a particular section of your pipeline. This takes the hassle out of draining and cleaning by stopping the flow from within. This ice plug serves as a barrier to block the flow during servicing and naturally thaws once the job is done. No matter the pipe, or the flow, Quick Freeze is the way to go!
Industrial
Factories and manufacturers make up the vast majority of our clientele and this is because the industrial machinery found on these sites require frequent maintenance. Industrial sites working with coolants and solvents, acids, oils and various other chemicals cannot afford to drain out their supplies, nor can they afford the subsequent clean. This is where we come in - we provide the highest quality in system isolation alternatives with the most effective and efficient pipe freezing in Sydney!
While the process of freezing can vary depending on the size and content, the outcome is always guaranteed to be the most efficient solution during repairs and installations. We work diligently to expedite our services without sacrificing on quality or performance. Between our expansive knowledge of freezing and isolation and our state of the art equipment you can be sure you’re getting the best!
Fire Services
Pipe freezing is a direct method of system isolation that utilises the effects of CO2 and Liquid Nitrogen to freeze the contents of a pipeline in a localised area. The cryogenic process begins by drawing out heat from the liquid within the pipe until it reaches a temperature well below its freezing point. Once a sufficient ‘freeze plug’ is formed, we will then monitor the flow of liquid nitrogen to ensure proper blockage during your installation or repair.
Fire hoses and fire water supplies are of the utmost importance during a time of emergency which is why it is important to ensure swift and efficient maintenance with as minimal downtime as possible. Lucky for you, Quick Freeze are Sydney’s leading experts on all your pipe freezing needs!
Air Conditioning
In the event of an air conditioner malfunctioning, you might decide to contact a local repairman to identify the problem. In many cases, however, your local repairman might contact us to freeze the pipes of your air conditioning system in order to properly assess the damage.
Central air conditioning systems in both residential and commercial properties withstand extreme heat and sub-zero temperatures at various times throughout the year. This ultimately makes for a potentially volatile environment for your pipes and plumbing repairs require extreme care. In order to ensure a thorough inspection it is imperative to prevent the water flow between the pipes in question. Call Quick Freeze today before all your air conditioning repairs and maintenance and help us freeze your pipes today!
Quick Freeze are an incredible team to work with. Their prompt timing, friendly service and state of the art technology makes a basic installation a total breeze! I call on them for every commercial job and have never been let down.
Joe
WS Pipework & Fixtures
The Quick Freeze team has been our go-to for a couple of years now. We have called on them a couple of times during our scheduled maintenance and they’ve been great. They have a wide understanding of our pipeline system and even helped us to avoid a catastrophic burst!
Mattias
Plus Industries
I’ve used Quick Freeze’s services for over 10 years now and have never had a problem. They are quick and efficient and really know their stuff. I recommend them to all the local plumbers and rave about their services regularly. Would highly recommend.

Plantation Shutters - Wonderful Product and Wonderful Provider/Installer!!!  We have been keen to have plantation shutters since our first sighting of them - and oh-so-many years of frustration with various alternatives.  From first contact, through the measurement and quote, to the delivery and installation, Central Coast Shutters, Blinds & Awnings have been magnificent!  Absolutely terrific product!  MURRAY has been there throughout our ordering and installation - and we cannot imagine a better `guide' to our proud ownership of these amazing shutters. Friendly, highly-informative, efficient and superb in all aspects.  No doubt, we cannot recommend Central Coast Shutters, Blinds & Awnings highly enough!  Pretty well PERFECT!!!

Murray did a fantastic job with our shutters and blinds! We couldn’t be happier with the whole process. He explained all our options in detail which really helped when we had no idea on any of it and this was something that didn’t happen when we had a quote off other companies. Murray let us know as soon as he received the blinds and shutters and installed them the following day which was amazing. We highly recommended Murray!

Kalvin and I cannot thank you enough for the home you have created for us. At every turn there was a new challenge and an ever increasing scope. Nothing was ever too hard or a problem for you.
You were always considerate of my requirement for beautiful detailing and you and your team have achieved this everywhere we look.
We cannot thank you enough for not leaving and saying you have had enough, and having continuing and committing to complete the build.
Thank you for your honesty, your fairness with pricing and your calm demeanour really helped me when the pressure was on.
See you when we are ready for the cream shed reno. Many thanks.

Mark Tregea
Garmisch helped design our front feature gate and then fabricated and installed it a short time later. Dealing with them was a breeze and the nothing was an issue for their team. If only there were more tradesmen with the professionalism and time management of Garmisch Fabrication. Thanks for your help guys!
Ben Scerri
I have used Garmisch for several projects over the past 17 years (both around my home as well as for body corporate works within my residential estate) and have always found their quality and customer service second to none.  I have no hesitation in recommending them for any fencing or balustrading job.

BRIDGET WALCH'S BIO
I live on a farm in Tasmania and am constantly amazed about the raw beauty of our four distinct seasons. As I reflect about the magic of nature I often watch the eagles flying high – contemplating life and the opportunities it presents to each of us.
As a celebrant I am extremely fortunate to work with people – preparing and writing ceremonies for marriages, funerals, namings, renewal of vows and commitments.
I am privileged to learn and grow as I work with the many people who choose my services. I look forward to working with you ….x

Welcome to Cottesloe Golf Club
Founded over a century ago in 1908, Cottesloe Golf Club established its first links course close by the sea, where the existing Sea View Golf Club exists today. With aspirations of achieving course championship status, in 1931 the Club moved to its present site in Swanbourne, where a new 18 hole course was carved from the scrub and sand hills using a horse and plough by a group of willing volunteers.
Since that time, the club has been a prominent part of the history of golf in Western Australia and has played host to recent events including the Amateur Golf Championships of Australia, the Australian Junior Interstate Series and the WA Open Championship.

​
The Humpty Doo & Rural Area Golf Club began in November 1984 on Lindsay & Elaine Creek’s 5 acre block at Humpty Doo. A small group of locals met regularly on Sunday mornings for a round on their 4 hole course with sand greens, located around the house & yards.
​
During 1985 the club acquired a section of land off Pioneer Drive for future development as an 18 hole golf course. By October 1986 there were 155 foundation members. Dave Ayers was elected President in early 1987, and work started in earnest clearing the thick bush which would eventually become the 9 holes on which we play today. Many hours of volunteer labour were spent establishing the course, clearing the fairways, picking up sticks, digging out tree roots & constructing the first four sand greens.
​
The original clubhouse consisted of four poles supporting a shadecloth roof, & the toilet was air conditioned with no roof… only to be used in emergencies! The first competition played on the new course (using a combination of the four holes played over & over) was the June 1987 Monthly Medal. Players had to contend with sand, speargrass & bulldust, & often ended up filthy by the end of the round.
​
Humpty Doo Golf Club has come a long way since those early days, thanks to the dedication of our many volunteers, who continue to provide much of the support for club & course improvements today.

RAKING BUNKERS

REPAIRING PITCH MARKS
With the course opening after an extended rain period, repairing pitch marks has never been more important.
Pitch marks can ruin a putt, leave the green susceptible to disease and are just plain unsightly.
Ben shows how to correctly repair your pitch mark. And while you’re there, repair a couple that might have been forgotten. @ben_doney #repairingpitchmarks #pitchmarks #terreyhillsgolfandcountryclub

""We got married in May this year but our wedding had been postponed from May the year before (thank you Covid).
The support we received from Windaroo Lakes Golf Club was incredible. Lisa is just absolutely amazing and our day would not have been as perfect as it was without her!
The venue is beautiful, such a relaxed feeling when you are there. The food is amazing! We had so many compliments on absolutely everything about our day.
100% recommend Windaroo Lakes Golf Club for any events or even just for somewhere to go for a bite to eat!""

Welcome to Nudgee Golf Club
The Club originated in the late 1920’s. The Golf Club was formed in 1930 and the original clubhouse built shortly after. The Club progressively grew, creating a new 18 hole layout, opened in 1950, and a further nine holes opened in 1964, with the final nine holes added in 1991.
While the Nudgee Golf Club approaches its centenary, the land on which the club sits has been a traditional meeting place of the Turrbal people for thousands of years.
As an inclusive and considerate golfing community, we acknowledge our rich and shared history, and take the opportunity to appreciate this coming together of cultures which set strong foundations for the future of our new courses.
The Kurrai
18 Hole Classic Championship Course
To the West, a world-class 18 hole championship golf course that is both engaging and challenging. Be amazed by the The Kurrai [Curr-ii]– meaning sunset in the Turrbal language.
The Bulka
18 Hole Modern Links-style Course
To the East and bordered by the Kedron Brook, we present a modern 18 hole Links-style course. Be enthralled by The Bulka [Bull-ka]– the Turrbal word for sunrise.

Played most courses around Brisbane (save for the member only courses) by far the best; has it all, from wide open fairways, to very tight ones that favour the more accurate player. Greens were perfect, moderately fast. Staff were also brilliant.

Amazing staff. Thoroughly enjoyed a wedding there recently. Well done to all involved. Fantastic night.

Clubhouse Restaurant
With stunning views of Passage Peak and the Coral Sea, the stylish Clubhouse is the perfect location for a laid-back lunch, or light refreshments after a game of golf.
What you’ll love about the Clubhouse:
Getting to the Clubhouse is a fun and unique experience in itself - requiring a boat ride across to Dent Island.
The large windows offer magnificent views out over the Whitsundays and Passage Peak - and the Clubhouse is one of the best places to see humpback whales during their migratory season in July to September.
The menu is varied, and features plenty of local, seasonal produce.
The Clubhouse offers an a la carte Golfers Lunch for golfers only, as well as an $109pp lunch special, which includes return Island Links Transfers from Hamilton Island to Dent Island, and a two-course a la carte lunch.
Guests visiting for the lunch special can also choose to take part in a self-drive guided buggy tour of the course and island for $30pp. This optional tour is bookable and payable on the day. Please note all passengers must be a minimum 4 years of age.
The restaurant has a refreshment cart which services playing guests every day.

A Golf Course Described as “Nothing else like it in Australia”
A newly redeveloped golfing gem for the Geelong and Bellarine region. Lonsdale Links is a distinctive links experience, open to both the
public
and
Members

PLAY A ROUND

How the Course Plays
Strategically designed to reveal more of itself each time you play, our newly redeveloped course draws inspiration from trailblazer, Charles Blair Macdonald, and his colleagues Seth Raynor and Charles Banks.
Ogilvy Cocking Mead
designed the course as a deliberate throwback to an earlier age. The template holes you’ll find throughout make it a nostalgically challenging yet fun course, unique to Australia.
COURSE TOUR
Dining at Lonsdale Links
For those looking to visit outside of golf, our state-of-the-art, architecturally designed Point Lonsdale Clubhouse offers lunch, dinner, coffee, drinks, and snacks for golfers and non-golfers alike. With uninterrupted views of Lake Victoria, you’ll enjoy an
elevated and casual dining experience
