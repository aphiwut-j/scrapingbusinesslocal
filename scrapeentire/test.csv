About Debra
Debra is a Transpersonal Art Therapist, Artist, Teacher and Group Facilitator. She currently offers Transpersonal Art Therapy Sessions for all ages and facilitates an art therapy group at the Older Women’s Network in Newtown, Sydney.  Debra, also teaches Transpersonal Art Therapy at the College of Complementary Medicine.
Debra is passionate about drawing and painting. Throughout her healing journey, art has enabled her to gain a deeper understanding of herself and explore various aspects of her unconscious self. This exploration has added significant meaning and depth to her life, leading her to want to help others.
She offers private Transpersonal Art Therapy Sessions through her business ‘Art and You’ and assists others to heal, exploring and regaining their sense of self and reclaiming parts of themselves they may feel they have lost.
“I have had numerous clients visit me, enduring years of depression without finding a way to move forward. Through art therapy processes, they’ve been able to perceive a different perspective, gaining profound insights into themselves and their journey. The entire experience is very rewarding
.” – Debra
Over the past 15 years, Debra has worked with clients of all ages. She has observed that  children respond positively to the imaginative journey, finding that their imagery becomes a tool for creating meaningful stories. This process aids them in regulating emotions, gaining self-understanding and helping to create focus.
She has spent many years working creatively, using art therapy processes with clients through the NDIS and a number of years working with clients who have Dementia, through the DSA.  Her experience with Dementia, has been one of feeling like she meets the clients at a soul level.  Through observation and listening, she mostly, is able to find that creative thread which leads to an enjoyment of doing something which brings them focus and relaxation, as they absorb themselves in their creativity.
Debra holds a Diploma of Fine Arts and an Advanced Diploma of Transpersonal Art Therapy  and Counselling, from the College of Complementary Medicine as well as a Graduate Diploma in Holistic Counselling and Psychotherapy from Metavision.  She has trained  in dance movement therapy for trauma, with the DSA, giving her an even deeper understanding of the body and its role in the healing process.
Debra sees life as a creative poetic puzzle and enjoys holding the space, whilst she empowers her students and clients with tools and processes that enable them to start slotting new and old pieces into place, regaining a sense of wholeness and well-being.

What is Dry Ice Blasting?
Dry ice blasting is a revolutionary blasting method that uses small, compact dry ice pellets as the blasting material. The dry ice pellets are accelerated in a jet of compressed air similar to that used in traditional blasting methods.
BENEFITS of Dry Ice Blasting.
·        A Dry Cleaning Process: Dry ice blasting is a completely dry process because dry ice pellets consist of CO2 and vaporize immediately on contact with treated surfaces.
·        No Waste Disposal: The system produces no waste products. Only the coating that has been removed remains to be disposed of, and this can usually be swept or vacuumed from the floor.
·        Environmentally Friendly: Dry ice blasting is completely non-toxic and no hazardous chemicals are used. Costs connected with the disposal of blasting materials and solvents are saved. The CO2 is a byproduct from the extraction of natural gas.
·        No Abrasion: Dry ice blasting is non-abrasive and therefore surfaces are treated very gently. Wear and tear resulting from the use of steel brushes, scrapers and other blasting materials is avoided.
·        Improved Production Quality: Dry ice blasting often allows the  production equipment to be cleaned while in operation without the need for dismantling and costly downtime ... a significant economic benefit.
·        Fast & Effective: Dry ice blasting is ideal for removing coatings such as adhesives, varnish, oil, grease, coal dust, soot, mould release agents and bitumen - to name but a few of the materials we remove daily using the process.
·        Non-conductive: As the process is completely dry and non-conductive, dry ice blasting can be used where other methods are unsuitable. For example, electric motors and equipment with electric, pneumatic or hydraulic components can be cleaned direct using dry ice blasting.

How do we do it?
We are not owned by a Multi-National Corporation that distributes profits from your loss to their shareholders, we are your local Perth funeral directors.
Click here
for a full list of Funeral Homes trading on the Australian Stock Exchange.
Perth Cremation and Burials funeral home have one principal location in Malaga (rather than multiple branches) so our rent and staffing overheads are a fraction of the ‘Big Brand’ companies. Instead, we have ‘Mobile Funeral Arrangers’ who come to you at your convenience, anywhere in the Metropolitan Area.
We do not apply 200%-300% markups on the cost price of coffins, flowers, celebrant services etc.
We do not incentivise our staff or funeral director with bonuses if they reach their sales targets. WE DON’T BELIEVE IN SALES TARGETS! So there is no ‘upselling’ in an appointment with our staff.
We do not spend hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on advertising but rely on word of mouth from our satisfied clientele to spread our good name.

What is the difference between
a Burial and Cremation?
When it comes to saying goodbye to a loved one, there are several options available.
The most common include Burials and Cremation services.
A Funeral is typically performed with the body present in a coffin with mourners attending a Service, followed either by a Burial or Cremation.
Cremation sees the body reduced to ash which the family then choose whether to keep them in an Urn (or box), have them scattered at a location meaningful to them, or interred in a plot at the Cemetery.
Burial sees the body interred in the ground at one of the Metropolitan or Regional Cemeteries where the family can erect a Headstone or even a full Monument over the plot in Memory of their loved one. Burial Plots can be purchased to accommodate one, two, or even three family members in a single Grave site. We also provide burial caskets.
The cost of a Burial is significantly more than a Cremation (in Australia) due to the additional Cemetery Fees charged for;
Internment Fee – The cost to dig & refill the grave.
Plot/Grant Fee – basically a 25 year leasing fee on the tiny patch of land that is your loved one’s resting place.
Speaking from experience, we know how tough it can be to focus on the little things when dealing with a great loss.
This is why we offer a Premium Funeral (Burial and Cremation) Service at prices that are often $3,000 – $5,000 cheaper than our closest competitor. Discuss your requirements with our friendly funeral director at

Testimonials
Hear what our clients have to say
Absolutely wonderful. Professional, genuine and compassionate services provided by Gerard through to the lovely attendants on the day of the funeral. Nothing was too much including the price. You don’t need to use the Big Name Brands when you get this service for much less. Well done, team!
Jenny Tysoe
Thanks Gerard and Yasmin for being so compassionate and understanding in what was a difficult time for our family. They were very professional from the first phone call and were very accommodating on the day as we had some ad-hoc unusual requests. Thanks again and will highly recommended Perth cremations to anyone.
Michael Pham
Perth Cremations are an affordable and discreet company who managed my Mothers funeral with respect and sophistication.  I would highly recommend this business as value for money.  Nothing was too much trouble and any family issues were handled with professionalism and courtesy.  Thank you so much to Gerard, Maddy and Yasmin for helping me get through this difficult time with a minimum of fuss and decision making.

Frequently Asked Questions
I’ve never done this before. Where do I start?  What’s the process?
No matter which funeral home you decide to go with, the following information is applicable and will give you a step-by-step guide through the process of arranging a funeral for your loved one.
If a death is expected, do your research prior to the event so that your mind is not clouded with emotions and grief.
Once you have chosen your Funeral Home and a death has occurred, the Funeral Home will arrange for the transfer of your loved one from their place of passing.
If the deceased passed away in a facility that has cold storage, then transfer will occur during that facility’s regular operational hours.
If the deceased passed away at a facility (or at home) where there is no cold storage, the general rule is to have the body transferred within 6 hours from time of passing.
NOTE - If the death is subject to a Coronial Inquest then transfer will be made by the Coronial Team, not your nominated Funeral Director.
Meet Face to Face with your Funeral Arranger.  Ensure all family members who wish to take part in the Funeral Arrangements are present at this meeting, as this is when you will choose the date, time and location for the Funeral Service as well as selecting the coffin, flowers etc from the options offered.
If you requested that a Funeral Notice be placed in the West Australian Newspaper and/or online, it will be placed by your Funeral Arranger as soon as the date, time and location of the Funeral Service has been confirmed. If you have a preferred date for placement of the Funeral Notice, make sure you let your Funeral Arranger know.
Face to Face meeting with your Funeral Celebrant (if requested). Again, gather all family members who wish to be a part of this meeting as this is where the fine details of the Service will be discussed; from Pall Bearers to Eulogies, Memories to Poems, a Religious to Non-Religious feel; the celebrant will guide you through everything you hadn’t thought of, to make the Service a true reflection of your loved one’s life.
You may have requested to include a ‘Photo Tribute’, ‘Order of Service’ booklet and/or other Video/Printed material for your loved one’s Funeral Service. If your Funeral Home is taking care of these arrangements on your behalf, be sure to provide them with the requested information by the dates specified. As these products and services are often supplied by third party specialists, it’s important to give them enough time to complete your order to the highest quality.
Your Funeral Arranger and Celebrant will continue to liaise with you right up to the commencement of the Funeral Service so be sure to return any queries from them as soon as possible, and likewise, they will ensure they address any of your queries or last minute changes as a priority.
For Ashes and Death Certificate Information, see below.
When and where do I collect my loved one’s ashes after the cremation?
Unless alternative arrangements were made with your Funeral Director during the sign up process, your loved one’s ashes will be available for collection from the Main Office of the Cemetery where the cremation took place, 2 business days after the date of cremation.  Only the signatory on the paperwork can collect the ashes (unless an alternative person was nominated) and will need to present valid ID (Driver’s Licence etc) at time of collection.
*Note - No one will contact you to let you know that your loved one’s ashes are ready for collection but you can contact any of the Metropolitan cemeteries on 1300 793 109 if you want to confirm prior to collecting.
It is the responsibility of your Funeral Home to lodge the application for a Death Certificate for your loved one once the cremation/burial has taken place.
NOTE - Lodgement cannot take place prior to the cremation/burial date.
One of the documents you will fill out during the sign-up process will be the ‘Death Information Form’ which, once completed, contains all the information that will appear on the Death Certificate.
The Death Certificate is issued by the Registry of Births, Deaths & Marriages WA within 3-5 business days from the date lodged by the Funeral Home. The original is posted to the Funeral Home ONLY, and then the Funeral Home will post on to you, unless other arrangements such as collection in person or postage to a solicitor/Public Trustee have been made.
Allow 5-7 business days postage time (on top of the time to issue) as Australia Post are not the service provider they once were. 10-14 days is the general time between burial/cremation and receipt of the Death Certificate.
Note - A Priority issue of the Death Certificate can be ordered if required. Discuss with your Funeral Arranger as additional fees are payable.
What happens to the coffin when a body is cremated?
In Western Australia all bodies for cremation must be transferred to the Crematorium in an approved and sealed coffin. Once a coffin has entered the grounds of any of the Metropolitan or Regional Crematoria it is prohibited to be opened again and therefore all coffins are cremated with the deceased within.
Is it better to get cremated or buried?
This is an entirely PERSONAL decision based on an individual’s preference, religion, culture and/or customs. It is important to follow the deceased’s wishes if they have stipulated whether they wish to be cremated or buried in their Last Will & Testament, even if this is not what you or your family (or religious/cultural beliefs) would have expected.
How soon should a funeral be held?
There is no set time period when a funeral must be held.  Keep in mind that it takes approximately 5 days to organise a Full Service Funeral and not all your requirements may be able to be met if deciding on holding the funeral within a shorter time. However, the most important thing is that you take the time you need to find the right funeral service provider to suit your needs. With 100% free quotes and 10% Price Beat guarantees, we’re here to help you make that decision.
How much does a funeral cost?
While funeral costs vary, some vendors charge in excess of $8,000 for a funeral. We appreciate that cost is the last thing on your mind, and that funerals can be expensive for many Perth families. For this reason we offer funeral packages starting at $1,295 and typically provide a full service package for between $3,000 to $5,000 less than our competition.

How a Local Perth Family Started Their Own Funeral Home
(A story perhaps not unlike like your own?)
How does a family with almost nothing cover the sky-high costs of a funeral?
Where are the affordable solutions for families like ours that don’t have deep pockets for exorbitant funeral fees?
Years before founding Perth Cremations, my family struggled with these very questions. After years of battling illnesses and multiple cancers, my mother’s savings were depleted, along with ours. We were faced with arranging her funeral with little to no funds available to us without having to take a bank loan or plead for financial assistance from friends and relatives.
We resorted to scaling back on Mum’s Funeral.
Although it has been several years since her departure, we still wish we were able to honour and respect her life by providing her with the funeral service she deserved.
Perth is home to thousands who live this story each year.
They struggle to pay the exorbitant fees demanded by corporate-owned funeral homes—companies whose sole purpose is shareholder profits. With so many families needing help, we entered the funeral service industry and started Perth Cremations.
We’re not a big company… and it can be tough to stand toe-to-toe with many of the larger players… but we stand firm behind our promise to value people over profits.
Our passion drives us to offer you the most affordable funeral packages and services in the Perth Metropolitan area—without compromising on quality. With Perth Cremations, you can always be sure of one thing:
We’ll help you lay your loved ones to rest with a beautiful funeral service that won’t cost you the earth.
Respectfully yours,
Gerard Basili

Mary Jane Beach is an excellent counsellor. She is empathic, down to earth, encouraging and warm. I have seen her to debrief around work related matters and have felt so much better after talking to her. I thoroughly recommend her as a counsellor.

I met Mary Jane at a particularly crucial time in my life. She has been pivotal in helping me, and by extension my family and others close to me, to progress towards a life which is vastly richer, happier and infinitely more fulfilling than it was before.Mary Jane will always be integral to my continued growth as someone whose life is constantly enriched by fresh insights and by conscious reflection upon that life.Mary Jane's extensive life experience as well as her skill in focused personal counselling make it easy to relate to her guidance and recommendations and to put these into practice in real life.My life has changed immeasurably for the better because of Mary Jane's gentle but down to earth wisdom, and the honesty and care with which she has guided me through sometimes quite stormy patches in my life.This has also had an invaluable flow-on effect on my family relationships. Our family is much happier these days, due in no small measure to what I have gained from Mary Jane's help and influence in my own life.Mary Jane makes a difference.I cannot recommend her highly enough, ever.

She has such a wealth of experience & knowledge and I love how she makes me see things from a different & simpler perspective. I am the best version of me that I have ever been. I would highly recommend her

Even in this modern age, a lot of people don’t use counselling services because of the ‘fear’ of seeking help or because of the outdated idea that going to a professional counsellor means they are weak or going crazy.
The truth is that counselling services are now widely regarded as among the healthiest things that you can do for yourself or for the people you love who may be going through some difficulties.

About Me
I am an approved supervisor through
Pacfa
and the
Dept of Health
and I currently provide supervision to other health professionals privately as well as through
Blacktown Women and Girls Centre
.
I have been running my private practice for over 20 years. My primary theory of practice is solution focussed therapy. I find most people really just want their lives to be better, so working on solutions to create those changes is very effective.
How I came to be an approved Counsellor
Early career as a registered nurse
I come from a early successful career as a registered nurse. As a nurse, I went to work on Palm Island with its local indigenous community.  I went there thinking I could help, but encountered a very steep learning curve. I knew nothing when I arrived (very naïve) but I gained a great deal during my stay there.
Midwifery & Child Health
Midwifery was my next adventure and qualification, which I undertook in the UK.  I  then came back to Australia and worked as a midwife for 10 years also gaining a degree in maternal and child health.
Working at the Centre of Excellence for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
I then did a degree in health care management, which I discovered was definitely not for me. So I applied for a job at Redbank House, this is a centre of excellence for child and adolescent psychiatry. I worked on the child and family section. Families would come in for 6 week admission; the whole family would come from all over NSW. Very complex families, and proved a very interesting and challenging job that I loved!
While working at Redbank House, I gained a degree in counselling, then went on to do a 2 year degree in family therapy. It was a great opportunity to work intensely with families and a team of highly skilled professionals.
My private practice was established 20 years ago
It was while I was working at Redbank that I commenced my private practice which I established about 20 years ago.
While still running my private practice I also worked at St John of God where I had the privilege of working with Prof. John Saunders, the consultant to the WHO (World Health Organisation) on drugs and alcohol. Needless to say another steep learning curve which I thrived. I have a love of learning which I continue doing each day.

ABOUT ME
Maitri means adopting a generous openhearted approach to the self which is essential if change and healing are to occur.  We are often so focused on “problems out there” we fail to hear the continuous internal stream of criticism we rain down on ourselves that we never escape.  The alleviation of psychological distress and emotional pain starts with Maitri.

Our Happy Customers
Quality concrete and exceptional customer service at reasonable prices. We unfortunately needed concrete during a very wet winter, which caused some delays. Shelley was amazing at keeping in contact and giving her best estimate of how far away they were. Andy was able to work with us and our not standard concrete paths, which included moving some storm water pipes to make it all work. Andy and the team were prompt and efficient during the prep work and the pour. We are very happy with our concrete.
Thomas
So happy with the finished product. Can't believe how much work goes into exposed aggregate it was so worth it. Love your prompt service and your organisation and most of all hard work. THANKS HEAPS GUYS LOVE IT!
We are still getting comments from everyone who comes to our house. Would be more then happy to advertise your work if you wanted to put a sign out the front of our place.
Bethany
I was recommended by a friend. 65 sq meters of concreting completed. Andy, Shelly and the team, are professional in their conduct. They communicate, turn up when they say they will, leave a clean site and complete a professional job. You might wait in line to get the job done but MPC are popular for good reason. With decades of industry experience backed up by professional conduct, most other trade based operators could learn alot about customer service from this business. No hesitation in recommending MPC.

WEDDINGS
Your wedding, Your way, Anywhere, Anytime!!
Let me help you create your special day, and make your dreams come true.  Your ceremony can be large or small, formal or alternative. Marry the love of your life where ever you choose, in a garden, at your home, at a venue, on the beach, island or hill top... morning noon or night... I'll help you all the way!!
COMMITMENT CEREMONIES
A Commitment Ceremony can be held for couples who for personal or legal reasons are unable to Marry each other, but wish to commit to one another and celebrate their love in the presence of their family and friends.
RENEWAL OF VOWS
Renew your Marriage Vows all over again on a special anniversay or occasion. Or commit to one another to confirm a reconsiliation.  Some couples choose to renew their Vows after the birth of a first child, or perhaps to mark a new beginning after their children have reached adulthood...... Or simply to show the love,  and throw a party!
BABY NAMINGS
A lovely non-religious ceremony that enables parent(s) to welcome their child into the world and officially introduce them by name, to their loved ones.

This ceremony can be crafted to suit the family, and could include God Parents, or 'Supporters' and can be formal or informal.
Servicing the Gold Coast, it's Hinterlands, Logan, Brisbane, Northern NSW, and South Stradbroke Island.
I love my job, love meeting new couples and families, and love WEDDINGS!!
My ceremonies are all personally scripted to suit your individual needs, big, small, formal or casual. I can help with your ceremony style, venue suggestions, and basic equipment to help on the day. I have my own music system with cordless microphone, available at no extra cost, as well as a small table and chairs for signing paperwork.
Marry barefoot on the beach, in your garden, your chosen venue or your special private spot. I can help with your personal Vows and nerves on the day!!
I have a small quiet garden and Bail Hut for a simple no fuss elopement, and can help with 2 witnesses if required.

“IT’S A BREEZE TO PLAY AT THE BAY”
Rowes Bay Golf Club, located 10 minutes from the Townsville CBD, is nestled beside the sea and the city’s conservation parklands.  A picturesque course that flows with natural waterways, full array of flora and fauna and Castle Hill as the backdrop.  The ideal getaway for a relaxed social or corporate day gathering.
Complementing our main course is our 9 Hole “Par 3” course.  This is Townsville’s only short course that has something for all skill level and occasions.  Could be a quick social round before/after work or you may just want to work on your short game.
So whether you’re looking to enjoy a round in sunny Townsville, organize an event for your clients or wanting to raise funds for a great charity, we are the Club that will impress.

Moe Golf Club
Moe Golf Club is one of the Latrobe Valley’s finest golfing challenges.
It offers towering native gums lining snaking fairways. This 18 hole championship course is set in two parts. The first nine is slightly undulating with a number of different holes that require plenty of accuracy on the approach shots, the back nine is longer and opens up with views of picturesque
Lake Narracan
and surrounding mountains. The course features good sized bent greens and generous legend fairways. A delightful experience for golfers of all standards.
Moe Golf Club has a fully licensed clubhouse with a real family and friendly atmosphere. Green fee players and Group bookings are welcome.
Course open during daylight hours

WELCOME TO THE HUMPTY DOO GOLF CLUB
The Humpty Doo & Rural Area Golf Club is located just a short 30-minute drive down the track from Darwin. Head down the Stuart Highway, turn left into Girraween Rd at the Coolalinga traffic lights, continue along Anglesey Rd and turn left at Pioneer Drive. Follow the signs until you come to the ‘Big Tee’ on the left.
​
Our facilities are open to the public and include an air-conditioned club house, bar, kids play area, community meeting room, al fresco dining and the popular Rusty Putter Bistro. The verandah bar and outdoor dining area overlooking the 18th green is a great place to relax and soak up our famous sunsets.
​
The 18 hole 5855 metre Par 72 golf course consists of 9 holes, with grass greens and two tee positions on each hole. The wide flat fairways make easy walking, or you may prefer to ride in a motorised cart. Golfers of all abilities will enjoy the challenging layout. There is also a practice putting green with an attached bunker, and a driving range.
​
Club memberships
are available to suit both social and serious golfers, as well as social and seasonal guests.
​
Golf clubs
and
motorised golf carts

​
The Humpty Doo & Rural Area Golf Club began in November 1984 on Lindsay & Elaine Creek’s 5 acre block at Humpty Doo. A small group of locals met regularly on Sunday mornings for a round on their 4 hole course with sand greens, located around the house & yards.
​
During 1985 the club acquired a section of land off Pioneer Drive for future development as an 18 hole golf course. By October 1986 there were 155 foundation members. Dave Ayers was elected President in early 1987, and work started in earnest clearing the thick bush which would eventually become the 9 holes on which we play today. Many hours of volunteer labour were spent establishing the course, clearing the fairways, picking up sticks, digging out tree roots & constructing the first four sand greens.
​
The original clubhouse consisted of four poles supporting a shadecloth roof, & the toilet was air conditioned with no roof… only to be used in emergencies! The first competition played on the new course (using a combination of the four holes played over & over) was the June 1987 Monthly Medal. Players had to contend with sand, speargrass & bulldust, & often ended up filthy by the end of the round.
​
Humpty Doo Golf Club has come a long way since those early days, thanks to the dedication of our many volunteers, who continue to provide much of the support for club & course improvements today.

Awesome course and relaxed environment. Course kept to a very high standard and the pro shop is mostly concerned about you having a great time rather than ear bashing you on what you can and can't do.
Justin Peek

Friendly staff all round.

Great place to go and have a game of golf 18 holes and nice golden ale afterwards and a great place to go and have dinner with the family
Keith Clayton
Google Review
Had a lovely day at the course. The pro shop staff were very helpful with organising a tee off time and reshafting my club. Afterwards we enjoyed a few drinks in the bar area overlooking the course which was a great way to spend the afternoon. The prices are very reasonable and I can highly recommended the summer twilight golf, which is very affordable.

""We got married in May this year but our wedding had been postponed from May the year before (thank you Covid).
The support we received from Windaroo Lakes Golf Club was incredible. Lisa is just absolutely amazing and our day would not have been as perfect as it was without her!
The venue is beautiful, such a relaxed feeling when you are there. The food is amazing! We had so many compliments on absolutely everything about our day.
100% recommend Windaroo Lakes Golf Club for any events or even just for somewhere to go for a bite to eat!""

Swan Reach Golf Club is truly a unique community club.  The golf course is run and maintained by the passionate local members from the community.  There is a lot of work to be done, including ensuring the watering system is working and maintained, mowing the fairways and greens, moving the holes, staffing the bar etc.  The community takes a divide and conquer approach, sharing the workload to get it done.  The benefit of all this volunteer sweat and tears is that the
membership fees
and green fees are amongst the lowest in Australia.

Work from home, making use of the high speed fibre-optic connection or, embark upon the short commute to Melbourne CBD. Whatever the working day entails, enjoy the time once it has ended with a round of golf on one of the championship courses or participating in one of our many kids sports programs or member events.
