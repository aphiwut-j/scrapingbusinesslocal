What is chiropractic?
Chiropractic is a healthcare discipline that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, particularly the spine. Chiropractors primarily use their hands to perform manual adjustments and manipulations to the spine or other parts of the body. The goal of chiropractic care is to alleviate pain, improve function, and promote the body's natural ability to heal itself without the use of medication or surgery.
Chiropractors believe that proper alignment of the body's musculoskeletal structure, particularly the spine, allows the body to heal itself. They use various techniques, including spinal adjustments, manipulation, and other manual therapies to address issues related to the body's alignment, joint mobility, and overall musculoskeletal function.
Chiropractic services are commonly sought for conditions such as back pain, neck pain, headaches, and musculoskeletal issues. Chiropractors may also provide advice on exercise, ergonomics, and lifestyle changes to complement their treatments.

About
Charmaine is a Kinesiologist and Natural Therapist, helping others to improve their health and well-being since 2005. Over the years, she has mastered many aspects of gentle yet powerful natural treatments, and her methods combine Kinesiology, Spinal Flow, Forensic Healing, Body Talk, Access Consciousness, Theta and Pranic healing, ITA (Integrated Therapeutic Alignment) Reiki and many more. Charmaine is dedicated to helping others become the best version of themselves, and leading happy and healthy lives. Our subconscious thoughts and feelings can have a huge effect on our lives and sometimes prevent us from achieving wellbeing. These energy blocks and imbalances in our bodies can manifest as emotional issues and even physical symptoms, which can hold us back in everyday life.
By working with the body-mind-soul connection, Charmaine can help you address these subconscious issues, and help you create more positive and beneficial thought patterns. Once you’ve cleared these energy blocks and negative thought patterns, your body can then activate the healing process. Charmaine will work closely with you to find the issues, and arrive at the optimum treatment methods for you as an individual. Based in Baldivis, Western Australia, Charmaine has helped numerous people in Perth, WA and beyond, so whether you’re in Rockingham, Mandurah or further afield, you could benefit from Charmaine’s uniquely successful alternative therapy techniques. Some sessions can even be conducted over Skype.
If you’ve tried everything else to no avail, maybe it’s time to try out an Alternative Natural Therapist! Get in touch today - you owe it to yourself.

Services
Charmaine is a Natural Therapist and Kinesiologist who offers a wide range of services that can improve both your mental and physical health and well-being. Here are some of the main alternative therapy techniques that could help you:
Kinesiology
Spinal Flow
Forensic Healing
BodyTalk Therapy
Access Consciousness
Kinesiology
is a natural and non-invasive type of therapy, that makes use of gentle muscle monitoring techniques to identify certain blocks and imbalances in the body.  Kinesiology strives to treat the body holistically, recognising the fact that all of the systems of the body are linked.
It uses Western techniques, combined with ancient Eastern wisdom, to provide a gentle yet effective solution.
The premise of kinesiology is that the body has innate healing energy (or ‘Qi’, as it’s referred to in China). It is always doing its best to care for itself, but sometimes you may need to give it a helping hand and put your body into a better position. Flows of energy relate to all the muscles, organs and other tissues of the body that help make you a living being. Energy blocks, though, can manifest as symptoms such as:
Stress
Anxiety
Depression
Fatigue
Physical pain
Emotional problems
Neurological problems
Hormone imbalances
Nutritional problems
Loss of brain integration
Kinesiology doesn’t work by simply treating these symptoms though - you have to look at the body as a whole before you can treat the issue. By using muscle monitoring/muscle testing techniques, kinesiology practitioners can help reveal imbalances, identify the cause, and then help to resolve it. Whether physical, emotional or even spiritual, there could be various reasons for your current condition. A trained Kinesiologist such as Charmaine can access this information, and help you facilitate the natural healing process of your body. With her innovative methods and friendly persona, you’re likely to see significant results when you undergo this non-invasive form of natural therapy.
Spinal Flow
works with the spine and nervous system to increase the bodies life force energy so
that it can heal.
The body has its own wisdom and intelligence, but what happens over time is our bodies experience
chemical, physical and emotional stressors which get stored in the body and create blockages in our
systems and this affects our bodies healing abilities. These blockages can be found in the 7
Gateways of the spine and show up as pain, disease, illness and other physical symptoms.
Spinal Flow uses Access Points found in the sacrum and cranial areas. These access points are
actually areas of ease and by contacting them and expanding them, Charmaine is able to guide you
into bringing in more breath, sensing, movement and flow into the body creating a healing wave of
energy up through the spine and nervous system to the brain. This allows the nervous system to
send different signals allowing your bodies intelligence to find the blocks and release them.
Forensic Healing
involves collecting evidence about a condition much like a detective at the scene
of a crime. Forensic Healing will investigate the who, what, where and why clues in your energy field
as to the reasons you have your condition and release them using the application of different healing
pathways.
Your body stores all of your past experiences including thoughts, feelings and emotions which all
impact your life in some way. Any disfunction on a physical, emotional, energetic or spiritual level
creating issues such as pain, stress, anxiety, tiredness, fear, grief, hurt, low self-worth, relationship
issues, health issues and energy blocks can be investigated using Forensic Healing.
Using Biofeedback methods (similar to Kinesiology), Forensic Healing identifies the most impactful
times/stresses that created the blocks in the clients’ energy field, along with any negative life
patterns, emotions, belief systems etc. that have been stored in the cellular memory or DNA. When
these energetic blocks are released through applying the appropriate healing pathway, the situation
or condition changes and allows the body to heal itself.
BodyTalk Therapy
is another method that seeks to address and treat the ‘whole person’, rather than just the individual symptom. By looking at the bigger picture (overall emotional, physical and environmental factors) Charmaine can start to find the underlying cause of your issues by focusing on the bigger picture.
BodyTalk is therefore a completely custom and personalised method of treatment, which will be different for every individual. By allowing the body’s energy systems to be re-synchronised, the communication between all systems can be re-established; allowing them to operate as nature intended once again.
Ultimately, your body knows how to treat itself, but sometimes it needs a little help along the way, and Charmaine is an expert in finding the cause and solution for your ailments. With conversation and methods including tapping gently on your head, sternum and navel, Charmaine can tap into your body’s innate wisdom and help bring it back to its original balanced state.
Access Consciousness
is a powerful method of natural therapy, that can help you properly take control of your life again and change things you’ve never been able to before. It’s comprised of a simple set of tools, techniques and philosophies that empower you to create the changes in your life that you desire.
Charmaine is a natural therapist who is well-versed in various aspects of Access Consciousness, and is the perfect person to help you work through your issues in a productive way, and get on the road to healing. In your relaxed and comfortable sessions, you’ll work with her on a number of techniques for improved perspective on life, and the removal of these mental and energetic barriers holding you back.
Part of Access Consciousness is something called ‘BARS’. This refers to a set of 32 points on the head which, when touched gently, allow the flow of energy through these points. This then releases a cascade of thoughts, feelings, emotions, limitations, behavioural patterns, judgements, belief systems and more that have been stored and built-up throughout your lifetime. Having your ‘BARS’ run allows the clearing of limitations that you may have about different areas of your life, and helps you to stop living through past experiences.
Charmaine can also offer any combination of other modalities that are a priority for your body. If you’d like to learn more about these gentle and effective natural alternative therapy techniques, then get in touch today on

Testimonials
I cannot recommend Charmaine enough. I lost my husband a year ago after battling a very serious illness
for two years and have my own health issues. I have tried various mainstream and natural healing
modalities to assist my healing process, which has been more difficult due to a variety of factors. A friend
recommended Charmaine to me while visiting family in Perth. After two sessions with Charmaine, I finally
feel like ‘myself’, with immediate changes physically and emotionally. I am finally empowered to live life,
joyful and determined for my future. Charmaine’s skills in a variety of modalities and her own skills are a
gift. We are unique. We need unique healing for our individuality. It has been a blessing for me to find her.
Sharon - Tasmania
I highly recommend Charmaine and have recommended her to many friends. I have been seeing her for 2
years now and her work has literally saved my life. My first session I walked in with suicidal thoughts and
an hour and a half later they were gone and have never returned. Whenever I need a ""tune-up"" I head
straight to Charmaine and I am never disappointed with the results.
Christine - Darlington
Charmaine is a gifted and brilliant practitioner on both physical and metaphysical levels. Her commitment and ability to get a result has been incredible. I would recommend her to anyone seeking to grow, shift and change to a better human being. One of the best investments in self that I have ever made.

Thank you Charmaine for your commitment and love
Blessings - Mark
For at least the previous 12 months before I saw you last week I’ve had the most horrendous back and neck pain – which was only being managed by ridiculously regular Chiro and massage appointments Since I saw you I’ve had barely any back and neck pains. I thought I’d let you know as it’s a massive change for me and my life and I’m very thankful for what you have done for me.
Jemma – Secret Harbour
I suffered tummy problems for at least 7 years before seeing Charmaine. The pain I lived with daily is now in the past.. She also treated my ongoing battle with daily headaches and monthly migraines. I lived with this pain for so long I never thought it possible that I could put it behind me and live in peace and experience such balance and happiness within myself.
Amber – Warnbro
I can’t find enough words to say thank you, it’s a blessing that someone actually gave my wife some consideration and the fact that you cared about her is very touching…Thanks once again Charmaine – you really have touched our hearts. Keep up the good work!
Mark – Port Kennedy
Charmaine is a beautiful soul and unbelievably gifted energy healer who uses a whole range of modalities. I highly recommend anyone who is needing a lift, feeling out of sorts, stagnant, stuck, depressed, suffering with trauma, etc. to get in touch with her. She has helped me so much over the years… I cannot speak highly enough of her.
Kylie – Rockingham
My sessions with you have brought about major breakthroughs that I was hoping for. This new found       state of being for me has been miraculous as in a short space of 3 months I feel safe and secure in my work environment, I have a new relationship with a wonderful man, and am making and manifesting exciting plans for the future. I now know and can say with absolute conviction that if I really want to change what I don’t like about my life or if I want to manifest my goals, I will be returning to you for a tune-up!!  IT WORKS!!

About Maria
Born in Tully, Far North Queensland, I have been a Celebrant here in the Tropical North since 2008 and a JP Qualified since 2000.
Being a local I have a good knowledge of Tully, Mission Beach and surrounding townships and cities along the coast from Cairns to Townsville and can share with you some great ceremony location options, if you wish.
Every couple is special and unique and all share their own love story. It’s always a pleasure to share the couple’s joy, along with the gathering of family and friends on their very special day.  Whether you choose a ceremony with moving formality or one of relaxed simplicity, I care to make it both a memorable and truly personal occasion every time.
""Maria, thank you so much for making
the day so perfect and special!""

She currently offers Transpersonal Art Therapy Sessions for all ages and facilitates an art therapy group at the Older Women’s Network in Newtown, Sydney.  Debra, also teaches Transpersonal Art Therapy at the College of Complementary Medicine.
Debra is passionate about drawing and painting. Throughout her healing journey, art has enabled her to gain a deeper understanding of herself and explore various aspects of her unconscious self. This exploration has added significant meaning and depth to her life, leading her to want to help others.
She offers private Transpersonal Art Therapy Sessions through her business ‘Art and You’ and assists others to heal, exploring and regaining their sense of self and reclaiming parts of themselves they may feel they have lost.
“I have had numerous clients visit me, enduring years of depression without finding a way to move forward. Through art therapy processes, they’ve been able to perceive a different perspective, gaining profound insights into themselves and their journey. The entire experience is very rewarding
.” – Debra
Over the past 15 years, Debra has worked with clients of all ages. She has observed that  children respond positively to the imaginative journey, finding that their imagery becomes a tool for creating meaningful stories. This process aids them in regulating emotions, gaining self-understanding and helping to create focus.
She has spent many years working creatively, using art therapy processes with clients through the NDIS and a number of years working with clients who have Dementia, through the DSA.  Her experience with Dementia, has been one of feeling like she meets the clients at a soul level.  Through observation and listening, she mostly, is able to find that creative thread which leads to an enjoyment of doing something which brings them focus and relaxation, as they absorb themselves in their creativity.
Debra holds a Diploma of Fine Arts and an Advanced Diploma of Transpersonal Art Therapy  and Counselling, from the College of Complementary Medicine as well as a Graduate Diploma in Holistic Counselling and Psychotherapy from Metavision.  She has trained  in dance movement therapy for trauma, with the DSA, giving her an even deeper understanding of the body and its role in the healing process.
Debra sees life as a creative poetic puzzle and enjoys holding the space, whilst she empowers her students and clients with tools and processes that enable them to start slotting new and old pieces into place, regaining a sense of wholeness and well-being.

Hi, I’m Sharon Tal, The Soul Alchemist.
We live in a complex world. It’s no wonder so many of us feel blocked or have a feeling of disconnect, stuckness or lack in our lives.
As The Soul Alchemist, I have a calling to facilitate people’s healing journey, because let’s face it, we’ve all had hurts in our lives. I believe healing therapies have the potential to cleanse your body, heal your heart and nourish your soul.
By accessing and clearing the ‘black box’ of our memories, I help people move from survive and revive to thrive and beyond!
I work with traumas on many different levels to restore Self Love, and nurture the Inner Child in each and every one of us. Ultimately, my aim is to guide you to live to your fullest potential, even beyond your wildest dreams.
Are you ready to join me on this wonderful journey?
In trust,
HOW I CAN HELP
I specialise in clearing unresolved
traumas and blockages which may manifest in the following symptoms:
Stress, anxiety or depression
Feelings of disconnect, lack or fear
Self or external sabotage
Allergies
Relationship problems
Smoking and other addictions
Misunderstood anger
Prolonged grief
Physical pain, headaches, migraines
Weight gain/loss
Adrenal fatigue & TMJ (pain in the jaw)
Modalities
After more than 20 years working with thousands of clients, I've discovered that when you go through trauma, it's best to treat it like any other injury. It needs to be attended to. I offer many modalities to help you in the healing process:
Kinesiology
A non-invasive method of healing based on chiropractic and the ancient wisdom of the Chinese meridian system.
Counselling
Counselling in a safe, supportive environment with someone you trust offers a great opportunity to grow and heal.
Reiki & Seichem
Used for thousands of years, Reiki and Seichem allow us to tap into the unvesal energy that is your birthright.
RESET TMJ Healing
Even the slightest tension in the jaw muscles can cause the jaw to be out of balance, having a ripple effect throughout your body.
Psychic Readings & Tarot
A psychic reading or tarot card reading can help you to feel enlightened, empowered and offers positive guidance.
American Indian Healing
Embrace the ancient healing art practiced by American Indians to treat almost any condition whether psychological or physical.
Pet Healing
Pet healing helps to clear blockages, allowing trauma and stress to disperse or injuries and sickness to heal.
Ear Candling
Ear candling clears your sinus and ear congestion by removing wax build-up, removing wax that normal cleaning cannot.
AS A HEALER, I AM HERE TO SUPPORT YOU TO STEP INTO YOUR OWN
POWER AND STAND IN YOUR TRUTH, WHATEVER FORM THAT TAKES.

No matter the pipe, or the flow, Quick Freeze is the way to go!
Our services
Residential
Here at Quick Freeze we hold ourselves to the highest standard working ethic and ensure that regardless of the job, big or small, we put in 100% of our efforts towards a safe and effective freeze. This is because we believe that pipe freezing is the most cost and time effective method of system isolation.
When your home needs a plumbing repair, it can often lead to puddled mess, but with Quick Freeze we’ll ensure that your water flows only as you please. We provide a helping hand with your local plumber to help get your repairs and installations well underway without the messy pool!
Commercial
Plumbing can be messy work for any site but, when you have a business to run, the last thing you need is an extended downtime period for a repair or installation. Whether you run a bar, pub or restaurant you simply can’t afford to have your liquid flow disturbed for a prolonged period. Cue the Quick Freeze experts! We’ll provide the best pipe freezing alternatives to guarantee your business is back up and running in record time.
Pipe freezing involves the controlled use of liquid nitrogen to isolate and freeze a particular section of your pipeline. This takes the hassle out of draining and cleaning by stopping the flow from within. This ice plug serves as a barrier to block the flow during servicing and naturally thaws once the job is done. No matter the pipe, or the flow, Quick Freeze is the way to go!
Industrial
Factories and manufacturers make up the vast majority of our clientele and this is because the industrial machinery found on these sites require frequent maintenance. Industrial sites working with coolants and solvents, acids, oils and various other chemicals cannot afford to drain out their supplies, nor can they afford the subsequent clean. This is where we come in - we provide the highest quality in system isolation alternatives with the most effective and efficient pipe freezing in Sydney!
While the process of freezing can vary depending on the size and content, the outcome is always guaranteed to be the most efficient solution during repairs and installations. We work diligently to expedite our services without sacrificing on quality or performance. Between our expansive knowledge of freezing and isolation and our state of the art equipment you can be sure you’re getting the best!
Fire Services
Pipe freezing is a direct method of system isolation that utilises the effects of CO2 and Liquid Nitrogen to freeze the contents of a pipeline in a localised area. The cryogenic process begins by drawing out heat from the liquid within the pipe until it reaches a temperature well below its freezing point. Once a sufficient ‘freeze plug’ is formed, we will then monitor the flow of liquid nitrogen to ensure proper blockage during your installation or repair.
Fire hoses and fire water supplies are of the utmost importance during a time of emergency which is why it is important to ensure swift and efficient maintenance with as minimal downtime as possible. Lucky for you, Quick Freeze are Sydney’s leading experts on all your pipe freezing needs!
Air Conditioning
In the event of an air conditioner malfunctioning, you might decide to contact a local repairman to identify the problem. In many cases, however, your local repairman might contact us to freeze the pipes of your air conditioning system in order to properly assess the damage.
Central air conditioning systems in both residential and commercial properties withstand extreme heat and sub-zero temperatures at various times throughout the year. This ultimately makes for a potentially volatile environment for your pipes and plumbing repairs require extreme care. In order to ensure a thorough inspection it is imperative to prevent the water flow between the pipes in question. Call Quick Freeze today before all your air conditioning repairs and maintenance and help us freeze your pipes today!
Quick Freeze are an incredible team to work with. Their prompt timing, friendly service and state of the art technology makes a basic installation a total breeze! I call on them for every commercial job and have never been let down.
Joe
WS Pipework & Fixtures
The Quick Freeze team has been our go-to for a couple of years now. We have called on them a couple of times during our scheduled maintenance and they’ve been great. They have a wide understanding of our pipeline system and even helped us to avoid a catastrophic burst!
Mattias
Plus Industries
I’ve used Quick Freeze’s services for over 10 years now and have never had a problem. They are quick and efficient and really know their stuff. I recommend them to all the local plumbers and rave about their services regularly. Would highly recommend.

What is Dry Ice Blasting?
Dry ice blasting is a revolutionary blasting method that uses small, compact dry ice pellets as the blasting material. The dry ice pellets are accelerated in a jet of compressed air similar to that used in traditional blasting methods.

·        A Dry Cleaning Process: Dry ice blasting is a completely dry process because dry ice pellets consist of CO2 and vaporize immediately on contact with treated surfaces.
·        No Waste Disposal: The system produces no waste products. Only the coating that has been removed remains to be disposed of, and this can usually be swept or vacuumed from the floor.
·        Environmentally Friendly: Dry ice blasting is completely non-toxic and no hazardous chemicals are used. Costs connected with the disposal of blasting materials and solvents are saved. The CO2 is a byproduct from the extraction of natural gas.
·        No Abrasion: Dry ice blasting is non-abrasive and therefore surfaces are treated very gently. Wear and tear resulting from the use of steel brushes, scrapers and other blasting materials is avoided.
·        Improved Production Quality: Dry ice blasting often allows the  production equipment to be cleaned while in operation without the need for dismantling and costly downtime ... a significant economic benefit.
·        Fast & Effective: Dry ice blasting is ideal for removing coatings such as adhesives, varnish, oil, grease, coal dust, soot, mould release agents and bitumen - to name but a few of the materials we remove daily using the process.
·        Non-conductive: As the process is completely dry and non-conductive, dry ice blasting can be used where other methods are unsuitable. For example, electric motors and equipment with electric, pneumatic or hydraulic components can be cleaned direct using dry ice blasting.

How do we do it?
We are not owned by a Multi-National Corporation that distributes profits from your loss to their shareholders, we are your local Perth funeral directors.
Click here
for a full list of Funeral Homes trading on the Australian Stock Exchange.
Perth Cremation and Burials funeral home have one principal location in Malaga (rather than multiple branches) so our rent and staffing overheads are a fraction of the ‘Big Brand’ companies. Instead, we have ‘Mobile Funeral Arrangers’ who come to you at your convenience, anywhere in the Metropolitan Area.
We do not apply 200%-300% markups on the cost price of coffins, flowers, celebrant services etc.
We do not incentivise our staff or funeral director with bonuses if they reach their sales targets. WE DON’T BELIEVE IN SALES TARGETS! So there is no ‘upselling’ in an appointment with our staff.
We do not spend hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on advertising but rely on word of mouth from our satisfied clientele to spread our good name.

What is the difference between
a Burial and Cremation?
When it comes to saying goodbye to a loved one, there are several options available.
The most common include Burials and Cremation services.
A Funeral is typically performed with the body present in a coffin with mourners attending a Service, followed either by a Burial or Cremation.
Cremation sees the body reduced to ash which the family then choose whether to keep them in an Urn (or box), have them scattered at a location meaningful to them, or interred in a plot at the Cemetery.
Burial sees the body interred in the ground at one of the Metropolitan or Regional Cemeteries where the family can erect a Headstone or even a full Monument over the plot in Memory of their loved one. Burial Plots can be purchased to accommodate one, two, or even three family members in a single Grave site. We also provide burial caskets.
The cost of a Burial is significantly more than a Cremation (in Australia) due to the additional Cemetery Fees charged for;
Internment Fee – The cost to dig & refill the grave.
Plot/Grant Fee – basically a 25 year leasing fee on the tiny patch of land that is your loved one’s resting place.
Speaking from experience, we know how tough it can be to focus on the little things when dealing with a great loss.
This is why we offer a Premium Funeral (Burial and Cremation) Service at prices that are often $3,000 – $5,000 cheaper than our closest competitor. Discuss your requirements with our friendly funeral director at

Testimonials
Hear what our clients have to say
Absolutely wonderful. Professional, genuine and compassionate services provided by Gerard through to the lovely attendants on the day of the funeral. Nothing was too much including the price. You don’t need to use the Big Name Brands when you get this service for much less. Well done, team!
Jenny Tysoe
Thanks Gerard and Yasmin for being so compassionate and understanding in what was a difficult time for our family. They were very professional from the first phone call and were very accommodating on the day as we had some ad-hoc unusual requests. Thanks again and will highly recommended Perth cremations to anyone.
Michael Pham
Perth Cremations are an affordable and discreet company who managed my Mothers funeral with respect and sophistication.  I would highly recommend this business as value for money.  Nothing was too much trouble and any family issues were handled with professionalism and courtesy.  Thank you so much to Gerard, Maddy and Yasmin for helping me get through this difficult time with a minimum of fuss and decision making.
Michaela Lawrence
Frequently Asked Questions
I’ve never done this before. Where do I start?  What’s the process?
No matter which funeral home you decide to go with, the following information is applicable and will give you a step-by-step guide through the process of arranging a funeral for your loved one.
If a death is expected, do your research prior to the event so that your mind is not clouded with emotions and grief.
Once you have chosen your Funeral Home and a death has occurred, the Funeral Home will arrange for the transfer of your loved one from their place of passing.
If the deceased passed away in a facility that has cold storage, then transfer will occur during that facility’s regular operational hours.
If the deceased passed away at a facility (or at home) where there is no cold storage, the general rule is to have the body transferred within 6 hours from time of passing.
NOTE - If the death is subject to a Coronial Inquest then transfer will be made by the Coronial Team, not your nominated Funeral Director.
Meet Face to Face with your Funeral Arranger.  Ensure all family members who wish to take part in the Funeral Arrangements are present at this meeting, as this is when you will choose the date, time and location for the Funeral Service as well as selecting the coffin, flowers etc from the options offered.
If you requested that a Funeral Notice be placed in the West Australian Newspaper and/or online, it will be placed by your Funeral Arranger as soon as the date, time and location of the Funeral Service has been confirmed. If you have a preferred date for placement of the Funeral Notice, make sure you let your Funeral Arranger know.
Face to Face meeting with your Funeral Celebrant (if requested). Again, gather all family members who wish to be a part of this meeting as this is where the fine details of the Service will be discussed; from Pall Bearers to Eulogies, Memories to Poems, a Religious to Non-Religious feel; the celebrant will guide you through everything you hadn’t thought of, to make the Service a true reflection of your loved one’s life.
You may have requested to include a ‘Photo Tribute’, ‘Order of Service’ booklet and/or other Video/Printed material for your loved one’s Funeral Service. If your Funeral Home is taking care of these arrangements on your behalf, be sure to provide them with the requested information by the dates specified. As these products and services are often supplied by third party specialists, it’s important to give them enough time to complete your order to the highest quality.
Your Funeral Arranger and Celebrant will continue to liaise with you right up to the commencement of the Funeral Service so be sure to return any queries from them as soon as possible, and likewise, they will ensure they address any of your queries or last minute changes as a priority.
For Ashes and Death Certificate Information, see below.
When and where do I collect my loved one’s ashes after the cremation?
Unless alternative arrangements were made with your Funeral Director during the sign up process, your loved one’s ashes will be available for collection from the Main Office of the Cemetery where the cremation took place, 2 business days after the date of cremation.  Only the signatory on the paperwork can collect the ashes (unless an alternative person was nominated) and will need to present valid ID (Driver’s Licence etc) at time of collection.
*Note - No one will contact you to let you know that your loved one’s ashes are ready for collection but you can contact any of the Metropolitan cemeteries on 1300 793 109 if you want to confirm prior to collecting.
It is the responsibility of your Funeral Home to lodge the application for a Death Certificate for your loved one once the cremation/burial has taken place.
NOTE - Lodgement cannot take place prior to the cremation/burial date.
One of the documents you will fill out during the sign-up process will be the ‘Death Information Form’ which, once completed, contains all the information that will appear on the Death Certificate.
The Death Certificate is issued by the Registry of Births, Deaths & Marriages WA within 3-5 business days from the date lodged by the Funeral Home. The original is posted to the Funeral Home ONLY, and then the Funeral Home will post on to you, unless other arrangements such as collection in person or postage to a solicitor/Public Trustee have been made.
Allow 5-7 business days postage time (on top of the time to issue) as Australia Post are not the service provider they once were. 10-14 days is the general time between burial/cremation and receipt of the Death Certificate.
Note - A Priority issue of the Death Certificate can be ordered if required. Discuss with your Funeral Arranger as additional fees are payable.
What happens to the coffin when a body is cremated?
In Western Australia all bodies for cremation must be transferred to the Crematorium in an approved and sealed coffin. Once a coffin has entered the grounds of any of the Metropolitan or Regional Crematoria it is prohibited to be opened again and therefore all coffins are cremated with the deceased within.
Is it better to get cremated or buried?
This is an entirely PERSONAL decision based on an individual’s preference, religion, culture and/or customs. It is important to follow the deceased’s wishes if they have stipulated whether they wish to be cremated or buried in their Last Will & Testament, even if this is not what you or your family (or religious/cultural beliefs) would have expected.
How soon should a funeral be held?
There is no set time period when a funeral must be held.  Keep in mind that it takes approximately 5 days to organise a Full Service Funeral and not all your requirements may be able to be met if deciding on holding the funeral within a shorter time. However, the most important thing is that you take the time you need to find the right funeral service provider to suit your needs. With 100% free quotes and 10% Price Beat guarantees, we’re here to help you make that decision.
How much does a funeral cost?
While funeral costs vary, some vendors charge in excess of $8,000 for a funeral. We appreciate that cost is the last thing on your mind, and that funerals can be expensive for many Perth families. For this reason we offer funeral packages starting at $1,295 and typically provide a full service package for between $3,000 to $5,000 less than our competition.

How a Local Perth Family Started Their Own Funeral Home
(A story perhaps not unlike like your own?)
How does a family with almost nothing cover the sky-high costs of a funeral?
Where are the affordable solutions for families like ours that don’t have deep pockets for exorbitant funeral fees?
Years before founding Perth Cremations, my family struggled with these very questions. After years of battling illnesses and multiple cancers, my mother’s savings were depleted, along with ours. We were faced with arranging her funeral with little to no funds available to us without having to take a bank loan or plead for financial assistance from friends and relatives.
We resorted to scaling back on Mum’s Funeral.
Although it has been several years since her departure, we still wish we were able to honour and respect her life by providing her with the funeral service she deserved.
Perth is home to thousands who live this story each year.
They struggle to pay the exorbitant fees demanded by corporate-owned funeral homes—companies whose sole purpose is shareholder profits. With so many families needing help, we entered the funeral service industry and started Perth Cremations.
We’re not a big company… and it can be tough to stand toe-to-toe with many of the larger players… but we stand firm behind our promise to value people over profits.
Our passion drives us to offer you the most affordable funeral packages and services in the Perth Metropolitan area—without compromising on quality. With Perth Cremations, you can always be sure of one thing:
We’ll help you lay your loved ones to rest with a beautiful funeral service that won’t cost you the earth.
Respectfully yours,
Gerard Basili

Plantation Shutters - Wonderful Product and Wonderful Provider/Installer!!!  We have been keen to have plantation shutters since our first sighting of them - and oh-so-many years of frustration with various alternatives.  From first contact, through the measurement and quote, to the delivery and installation, Central Coast Shutters, Blinds & Awnings have been magnificent!  Absolutely terrific product!  MURRAY has been there throughout our ordering and installation - and we cannot imagine a better `guide' to our proud ownership of these amazing shutters. Friendly, highly-informative, efficient and superb in all aspects.  No doubt, we cannot recommend Central Coast Shutters, Blinds & Awnings highly enough!  Pretty well PERFECT!!!

Murray did a fantastic job with our shutters and blinds! We couldn’t be happier with the whole process. He explained all our options in detail which really helped when we had no idea on any of it and this was something that didn’t happen when we had a quote off other companies. Murray let us know as soon as he received the blinds and shutters and installed them the following day which was amazing. We highly recommended Murray!

Kalvin and I cannot thank you enough for the home you have created for us. At every turn there was a new challenge and an ever increasing scope. Nothing was ever too hard or a problem for you.
You were always considerate of my requirement for beautiful detailing and you and your team have achieved this everywhere we look.

Thank you for your honesty, your fairness with pricing and your calm demeanour really helped me when the pressure was on.

Michael Prackert
Lance and the guys do all of my fabrication work, very professional and highly skilled. They will create from scratch amazing additions to your home.
Mark Tregea
Garmisch helped design our front feature gate and then fabricated and installed it a short time later. Dealing with them was a breeze and the nothing was an issue for their team. If only there were more tradesmen with the professionalism and time management of Garmisch Fabrication. Thanks for your help guys!
Ben Scerri
I have used Garmisch for several projects over the past 17 years (both around my home as well as for body corporate works within my residential estate) and have always found their quality and customer service second to none.  I have no hesitation in recommending them for any fencing or balustrading job.

Awesome work, best on the Gold Coast. Amazing attention to detail!

Mary Jane Beach is an excellent counsellor. She is empathic, down to earth, encouraging and warm. I have seen her to debrief around work related matters and have felt so much better after talking to her. I thoroughly recommend her as a counsellor.

Mary-Jane absolutely changed my life. She helped & guided me through an extremely tough time. She has such a wealth of experience & knowledge and I love how she makes me see things from a different & simpler perspective. I am the best version of me that I have ever been. I would highly recommend her
Stephanie Sargent

I met Mary Jane at a particularly crucial time in my life. She has been pivotal in helping me, and by extension my family and others close to me, to progress towards a life which is vastly richer, happier and infinitely more fulfilling than it was before.Mary Jane will always be integral to my continued growth as someone whose life is constantly enriched by fresh insights and by conscious reflection upon that life.Mary Jane's extensive life experience as well as her skill in focused personal counselling make it easy to relate to her guidance and recommendations and to put these into practice in real life.My life has changed immeasurably for the better because of Mary Jane's gentle but down to earth wisdom, and the honesty and care with which she has guided me through sometimes quite stormy patches in my life.This has also had an invaluable flow-on effect on my family relationships. Our family is much happier these days, due in no small measure to what I have gained from Mary Jane's help and influence in my own life.Mary Jane makes a difference.I cannot recommend her highly enough, ever.

I highly recommend Beach's Family Therapy Centre, Mary Jane made herself available when we really needed her. Her advice was extremely important to us and we are happier because of it.

About Me
I am an approved supervisor through
Pacfa
and the
Dept of Health
and I currently provide supervision to other health professionals privately as well as through
Blacktown Women and Girls Centre
.
I have been running my private practice for over 20 years. My primary theory of practice is solution focussed therapy. I find most people really just want their lives to be better, so working on solutions to create those changes is very effective.
How I came to be an approved Counsellor
Early career as a registered nurse
I come from a early successful career as a registered nurse. As a nurse, I went to work on Palm Island with its local indigenous community.  I went there thinking I could help, but encountered a very steep learning curve. I knew nothing when I arrived (very naïve) but I gained a great deal during my stay there.
Midwifery & Child Health
Midwifery was my next adventure and qualification, which I undertook in the UK.  I  then came back to Australia and worked as a midwife for 10 years also gaining a degree in maternal and child health.
Working at the Centre of Excellence for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
I then did a degree in health care management, which I discovered was definitely not for me. So I applied for a job at Redbank House, this is a centre of excellence for child and adolescent psychiatry. I worked on the child and family section. Families would come in for 6 week admission; the whole family would come from all over NSW. Very complex families, and proved a very interesting and challenging job that I loved!
While working at Redbank House, I gained a degree in counselling, then went on to do a 2 year degree in family therapy. It was a great opportunity to work intensely with families and a team of highly skilled professionals.
My private practice was established 20 years ago
It was while I was working at Redbank that I commenced my private practice which I established about 20 years ago.
While still running my private practice I also worked at St John of God where I had the privilege of working with Prof. John Saunders, the consultant to the WHO (World Health Organisation) on drugs and alcohol. Needless to say another steep learning curve which I thrived. I have a love of learning which I continue doing each day.

If so, here what you can do:

ABOUT ME
Maitri means adopting a generous openhearted approach to the self which is essential if change and healing are to occur.  We are often so focused on “problems out there” we fail to hear the continuous internal stream of criticism we rain down on ourselves that we never escape.  The alleviation of psychological distress and emotional pain starts with Maitri.

Our Happy Customers
Quality concrete and exceptional customer service at reasonable prices. We unfortunately needed concrete during a very wet winter, which caused some delays. Shelley was amazing at keeping in contact and giving her best estimate of how far away they were. Andy was able to work with us and our not standard concrete paths, which included moving some storm water pipes to make it all work. Andy and the team were prompt and efficient during the prep work and the pour. We are very happy with our concrete.
Thomas
So happy with the finished product. Can't believe how much work goes into exposed aggregate it was so worth it. Love your prompt service and your organisation and most of all hard work. THANKS HEAPS GUYS LOVE IT!
We are still getting comments from everyone who comes to our house. Would be more then happy to advertise your work if you wanted to put a sign out the front of our place.
Bethany
I was recommended by a friend. 65 sq meters of concreting completed. Andy, Shelly and the team, are professional in their conduct. They communicate, turn up when they say they will, leave a clean site and complete a professional job. You might wait in line to get the job done but MPC are popular for good reason. With decades of industry experience backed up by professional conduct, most other trade based operators could learn alot about customer service from this business. No hesitation in recommending MPC.

BRIDGET WALCH'S BIO
I live on a farm in Tasmania and am constantly amazed about the raw beauty of our four distinct seasons. As I reflect about the magic of nature I often watch the eagles flying high – contemplating life and the opportunities it presents to each of us.
As a celebrant I am extremely fortunate to work with people – preparing and writing ceremonies for marriages, funerals, namings, renewal of vows and commitments.
I am privileged to learn and grow as I work with the many people who choose my services. I look forward to working with you ….x

WEDDINGS
Your wedding, Your way, Anywhere, Anytime!!
Let me help you create your special day, and make your dreams come true.  Your ceremony can be large or small, formal or alternative. Marry the love of your life where ever you choose, in a garden, at your home, at a venue, on the beach, island or hill top... morning noon or night... I'll help you all the way!!
COMMITMENT CEREMONIES
A Commitment Ceremony can be held for couples who for personal or legal reasons are unable to Marry each other, but wish to commit to one another and celebrate their love in the presence of their family and friends.
RENEWAL OF VOWS
Renew your Marriage Vows all over again on a special anniversay or occasion. Or commit to one another to confirm a reconsiliation.  Some couples choose to renew their Vows after the birth of a first child, or perhaps to mark a new beginning after their children have reached adulthood...... Or simply to show the love,  and throw a party!
BABY NAMINGS
A lovely non-religious ceremony that enables parent(s) to welcome their child into the world and officially introduce them by name, to their loved ones.

This ceremony can be crafted to suit the family, and could include God Parents, or 'Supporters' and can be formal or informal.
Servicing the Gold Coast, it's Hinterlands, Logan, Brisbane, Northern NSW, and South Stradbroke Island.
I love my job, love meeting new couples and families, and love WEDDINGS!!
My ceremonies are all personally scripted to suit your individual needs, big, small, formal or casual. I can help with your ceremony style, venue suggestions, and basic equipment to help on the day. I have my own music system with cordless microphone, available at no extra cost, as well as a small table and chairs for signing paperwork.
Marry barefoot on the beach, in your garden, your chosen venue or your special private spot. I can help with your personal Vows and nerves on the day!!
I have a small quiet garden and Bail Hut for a simple no fuss elopement, and can help with 2 witnesses if required.

LEARN MORE
Welcome to Cottesloe Golf Club
Founded over a century ago in 1908, Cottesloe Golf Club established its first links course close by the sea, where the existing Sea View Golf Club exists today. With aspirations of achieving course championship status, in 1931 the Club moved to its present site in Swanbourne, where a new 18 hole course was carved from the scrub and sand hills using a horse and plough by a group of willing volunteers.
Since that time, the club has been a prominent part of the history of golf in Western Australia and has played host to recent events including the Amateur Golf Championships of Australia, the Australian Junior Interstate Series and the WA Open Championship.

Hole #11 |  Par 3

Played from an elevated tee, careful club selection is required into this exposed but short par 3.  The green features a strong slope from back to front and is surrounded by four bunkers and a hollow, that make getting up and down a challenge.

“IT’S A BREEZE TO PLAY AT THE BAY”
Rowes Bay Golf Club, located 10 minutes from the Townsville CBD, is nestled beside the sea and the city’s conservation parklands.  A picturesque course that flows with natural waterways, full array of flora and fauna and Castle Hill as the backdrop.  The ideal getaway for a relaxed social or corporate day gathering.
Complementing our main course is our 9 Hole “Par 3” course.  This is Townsville’s only short course that has something for all skill level and occasions.  Could be a quick social round before/after work or you may just want to work on your short game.
So whether you’re looking to enjoy a round in sunny Townsville, organize an event for your clients or wanting to raise funds for a great charity, we are the Club that will impress.

“IT’S A BREEZE TO PLAY AT THE BAY”
Rowes Bay Golf Club, located 10 minutes from the Townsville CBD, is nestled beside the sea and the city’s conservation parklands.  A picturesque course that flows with natural waterways, full array of flora and fauna and Castle Hill as the backdrop.  The ideal getaway for a relaxed social or corporate day gathering.
Complementing our main course is our 9 Hole “Par 3” course.  This is Townsville’s only short course that has something for all skill level and occasions.  Could be a quick social round before/after work or you may just want to work on your short game.
So whether you’re looking to enjoy a round in sunny Townsville, organize an event for your clients or wanting to raise funds for a great charity, we are the Club that will impress.

Moe Golf Club
Moe Golf Club is one of the Latrobe Valley’s finest golfing challenges.
It offers towering native gums lining snaking fairways. This 18 hole championship course is set in two parts. The first nine is slightly undulating with a number of different holes that require plenty of accuracy on the approach shots, the back nine is longer and opens up with views of picturesque
Lake Narracan
and surrounding mountains. The course features good sized bent greens and generous legend fairways. A delightful experience for golfers of all standards.
Moe Golf Club has a fully licensed clubhouse with a real family and friendly atmosphere. Green fee players and Group bookings are welcome.
Course open during daylight hours

WELCOME TO THE HUMPTY DOO GOLF CLUB
The Humpty Doo & Rural Area Golf Club is located just a short 30-minute drive down the track from Darwin. Head down the Stuart Highway, turn left into Girraween Rd at the Coolalinga traffic lights, continue along Anglesey Rd and turn left at Pioneer Drive. Follow the signs until you come to the ‘Big Tee’ on the left.
​
Our facilities are open to the public and include an air-conditioned club house, bar, kids play area, community meeting room, al fresco dining and the popular Rusty Putter Bistro. The verandah bar and outdoor dining area overlooking the 18th green is a great place to relax and soak up our famous sunsets.
​
The 18 hole 5855 metre Par 72 golf course consists of 9 holes, with grass greens and two tee positions on each hole. The wide flat fairways make easy walking, or you may prefer to ride in a motorised cart. Golfers of all abilities will enjoy the challenging layout. There is also a practice putting green with an attached bunker, and a driving range.
​
Club memberships
are available to suit both social and serious golfers, as well as social and seasonal guests.
​
Golf clubs
and
motorised golf carts
are available for hire.
​
Green fee players and visitors are welcome to play at all times other than during club competitions.

​
The Humpty Doo & Rural Area Golf Club began in November 1984 on Lindsay & Elaine Creek’s 5 acre block at Humpty Doo. A small group of locals met regularly on Sunday mornings for a round on their 4 hole course with sand greens, located around the house & yards.
​
During 1985 the club acquired a section of land off Pioneer Drive for future development as an 18 hole golf course. By October 1986 there were 155 foundation members. Dave Ayers was elected President in early 1987, and work started in earnest clearing the thick bush which would eventually become the 9 holes on which we play today. Many hours of volunteer labour were spent establishing the course, clearing the fairways, picking up sticks, digging out tree roots & constructing the first four sand greens.
​
The original clubhouse consisted of four poles supporting a shadecloth roof, & the toilet was air conditioned with no roof… only to be used in emergencies! The first competition played on the new course (using a combination of the four holes played over & over) was the June 1987 Monthly Medal. Players had to contend with sand, speargrass & bulldust, & often ended up filthy by the end of the round.
​
Humpty Doo Golf Club has come a long way since those early days, thanks to the dedication of our many volunteers, who continue to provide much of the support for club & course improvements today.

RAKING BUNKERS

REPAIRING PITCH MARKS
With the course opening after an extended rain period, repairing pitch marks has never been more important.
Pitch marks can ruin a putt, leave the green susceptible to disease and are just plain unsightly.
Ben shows how to correctly repair your pitch mark. And while you’re there, repair a couple that might have been forgotten. @ben_doney #repairingpitchmarks #pitchmarks #terreyhillsgolfandcountryclub

Awesome course and relaxed environment. Course kept to a very high standard and the pro shop is mostly concerned about you having a great time rather than ear bashing you on what you can and can't do.
Justin Peek

Played there on Saturday awesome course and looking forward to playing it again. Eagled the 16th 🏌🏼👍🏽 alway makes you want to come back.
Friendly staff all round.

Great place to go and have a game of golf 18 holes and nice golden ale afterwards and a great place to go and have dinner with the family
Keith Clayton
Google Review
Had a lovely day at the course. The pro shop staff were very helpful with organising a tee off time and reshafting my club. Afterwards we enjoyed a few drinks in the bar area overlooking the course which was a great way to spend the afternoon. The prices are very reasonable and I can highly recommended the summer twilight golf, which is very affordable.

""We got married in May this year but our wedding had been postponed from May the year before (thank you Covid).
The support we received from Windaroo Lakes Golf Club was incredible. Lisa is just absolutely amazing and our day would not have been as perfect as it was without her!
The venue is beautiful, such a relaxed feeling when you are there. The food is amazing! We had so many compliments on absolutely everything about our day.
100% recommend Windaroo Lakes Golf Club for any events or even just for somewhere to go for a bite to eat!""

Welcome to Nudgee Golf Club
The Club originated in the late 1920’s. The Golf Club was formed in 1930 and the original clubhouse built shortly after. The Club progressively grew, creating a new 18 hole layout, opened in 1950, and a further nine holes opened in 1964, with the final nine holes added in 1991.
While the Nudgee Golf Club approaches its centenary, the land on which the club sits has been a traditional meeting place of the Turrbal people for thousands of years.
As an inclusive and considerate golfing community, we acknowledge our rich and shared history, and take the opportunity to appreciate this coming together of cultures which set strong foundations for the future of our new courses.
The Kurrai
18 Hole Classic Championship Course
To the West, a world-class 18 hole championship golf course that is both engaging and challenging. Be amazed by the The Kurrai [Curr-ii]– meaning sunset in the Turrbal language.
The Bulka
18 Hole Modern Links-style Course
To the East and bordered by the Kedron Brook, we present a modern 18 hole Links-style course. Be enthralled by The Bulka [Bull-ka]– the Turrbal word for sunrise.

Played most courses around Brisbane (save for the member only courses) by far the best; has it all, from wide open fairways, to very tight ones that favour the more accurate player. Greens were perfect, moderately fast. Staff were also brilliant.
Liam Morris

Amazing staff. Thoroughly enjoyed a wedding there recently. Well done to all involved. Fantastic night.

We came to the Fairways Bistro in a large group booking. The food off the menu and daily specials board was very good. The all staff were very pleasant.

Clubhouse Restaurant
With stunning views of Passage Peak and the Coral Sea, the stylish Clubhouse is the perfect location for a laid-back lunch, or light refreshments after a game of golf.
What you’ll love about the Clubhouse:
Getting to the Clubhouse is a fun and unique experience in itself - requiring a boat ride across to Dent Island.
The large windows offer magnificent views out over the Whitsundays and Passage Peak - and the Clubhouse is one of the best places to see humpback whales during their migratory season in July to September.
The menu is varied, and features plenty of local, seasonal produce.
The Clubhouse offers an a la carte Golfers Lunch for golfers only, as well as an $109pp lunch special, which includes return Island Links Transfers from Hamilton Island to Dent Island, and a two-course a la carte lunch.
Guests visiting for the lunch special can also choose to take part in a self-drive guided buggy tour of the course and island for $30pp. This optional tour is bookable and payable on the day. Please note all passengers must be a minimum 4 years of age.
The restaurant has a refreshment cart which services playing guests every day.

A Golf Course Described as “Nothing else like it in Australia”

public
and

How the Course Plays
Strategically designed to reveal more of itself each time you play, our newly redeveloped course draws inspiration from trailblazer, Charles Blair Macdonald, and his colleagues Seth Raynor and Charles Banks.
Ogilvy Cocking Mead
designed the course as a deliberate throwback to an earlier age. The template holes you’ll find throughout make it a nostalgically challenging yet fun course, unique to Australia.
COURSE TOUR
Dining at Lonsdale Links
For those looking to visit outside of golf, our state-of-the-art, architecturally designed Point Lonsdale Clubhouse offers lunch, dinner, coffee, drinks, and snacks for golfers and non-golfers alike. With uninterrupted views of Lake Victoria, you’ll enjoy an
elevated and casual dining experience

Swan Reach Golf Club is truly a unique community club.  The golf course is run and maintained by the passionate local members from the community.  There is a lot of work to be done, including ensuring the watering system is working and maintained, mowing the fairways and greens, moving the holes, staffing the bar etc.  The community takes a divide and conquer approach, sharing the workload to get it done.  The benefit of all this volunteer sweat and tears is that the
membership fees
and green fees are amongst the lowest in Australia.

Swim a few lengths, meet friends for tennis, pop in to the gym for a workout or simply enjoy the spectacular surroundings whilst out on a walk. Work from home, making use of the high speed fibre-optic connection or, embark upon the short commute to Melbourne CBD. Whatever the working day entails, enjoy the time once it has ended with a round of golf on one of the championship courses or participating in one of our many kids sports programs or member events.
