What is chiropractic?
Chiropractic is a healthcare discipline that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, particularly the spine. Chiropractors primarily use their hands to perform manual adjustments and manipulations to the spine or other parts of the body. The goal of chiropractic care is to alleviate pain, improve function, and promote the body's natural ability to heal itself without the use of medication or surgery.
Chiropractors believe that proper alignment of the body's musculoskeletal structure, particularly the spine, allows the body to heal itself. They use various techniques, including spinal adjustments, manipulation, and other manual therapies to address issues related to the body's alignment, joint mobility, and overall musculoskeletal function.
Chiropractic services are commonly sought for conditions such as back pain, neck pain, headaches, and musculoskeletal issues. Chiropractors may also provide advice on exercise, ergonomics, and lifestyle changes to complement their treatments.
Benefits of chiropractic care

its functions.
